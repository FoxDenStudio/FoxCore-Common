#FoxCore Common
I'm rewriting my plugins, basically, and this repo is now the starting point of that.

This time, i'm doing everything the right way, as best as I can, by trying to write more abstract and durable code,
now that I have a much better idea of what I want my plugins to look like. 

While this is mostly a rewrite of FoxGuard, I think these changes will be beneficial toward future plugins of mine 
as well, and perhaps even to other plugin developers.
