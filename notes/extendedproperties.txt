Objects should be able to accept arbitrary extensions to their functionality, with the following goals

- queryability
    extensions need to be queryable to be useful.
- lookup performance
- enumerability
    you should be able to get a list of extensions
- representability
    extensions should have a sensible way to be represented

I think how I've written attributes does not adequately cover all the use cases i have for them, such as

- flags
- config options
- commands
- links???

I suppose i could follow programming paradigms such as "everything is a method", implying that fields are composed of getters and setters.
