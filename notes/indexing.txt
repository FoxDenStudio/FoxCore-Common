I want objects to link to other objects, especially to objects of different types.

I also want it to be possible to have certain local objects that are not expressly in the main index
    - for example, i want it to be possible for local components to exist in a handler so that
        they are only loaded if the handler is loaded.

I think that all objects should always be loaded by the loader of their type,
    and that loaders should report any local objects to the correct loader to be loaded, in a recursive manner.

As a result, even if objects appear to be stored within each other in a file system loader,
    a database loader would still keep them separate, and instead of a "local index", keyed by object references
    and the respective internal link path.
