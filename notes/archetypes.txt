Archetypes primarily hold commands and attributes that will apply to all objects that inherit from that archetype

Should
------------
be configured once and remain constant
contain commands and attributes for objects that inherit from them
    they might have default property values for their attributes
    they also might have commands or more elaborate configuration of their own, that affects the inheriting objects.
archetypes should be instantiated before foxobjects
foxobjects should be able to include more than one archetype.
    generally objects will include only one, but will inherit archetypes from parent classes.


Should Not
------------
be modifiable through runtime commands
